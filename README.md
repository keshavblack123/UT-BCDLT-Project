# UT-BCDLT-Project

## Project Pitch

We are looking to build a decentralized peer-to-peer auction web application that is powered by a smart contract and allows users to participate in an open bidding system. The platform enables users to bid for various items listed for sale, as well as put up their own items for sale. Each auction would create a new smart contract with an end date and functionality to find the highest bidder. All bids are done through transactions to the smart contract using cryptocurrency. This website ensures transparency and security for all parties involved in the auction process. In addition, we could explore the possibilities of using blockchain to provide authenticity of the auction items and their owners.
